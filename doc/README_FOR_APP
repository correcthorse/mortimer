= mortimer

A secure, multi-user password management app. 

== DESCRIPTION:

mortimer is a password app that supports multiple users and basic permissions. The encryption uses
public key cryptography so that even if the database or the application itself is compromised, 
the stored passwords remain useless to an attacker.

Admin users have permission to all password entries on the system. Thus, it is important to keep admin users
to a minimum. Users may be given permission to root-level groups and any groups one level deep. This should provide granular enough permissions for general use.

== ENCRYPTION:

mortimer uses asymmetric encryption on the user level.  It work like so:

Imagine that we need to store a shared password, such as the password to an e-commerce admin.

Now, we need to give Tom access to that password, so we add him to the system.  

A unique public and private key will be generated for Tom.  Tom's public key is used to 
encrypt any password for which he is granted access.  Tom's private key is stored, symetrically
encrypted using his login password.

So, when we give Tom access to the e-commerce admin, Tom's public key is used to 
generate a uniquely-encrypted version of the password, just for Tom. 

When Tom goes to view the password, the system decrypts Tom's private key with his login password.
The decrypted private key can then be used to decrypt Tom's version of the e-commerce admin password.

So, if ten users have access to a given password, then ten uniquely-encrypted copies of that password
are stored on the system.  One benefit of this method is that, if the password changes, the password
is re-encrypted for each user, using each user's public key. This means that it's easy for changes in password
entries to be reflected for each user while maintaining completely siloed user password permissions.


==INSTALL:

=== TEST THE VAULT

Before deploying mortimer to production, install it locally, and run it in development mode.

=== CONFIGURATION

Security configuration exists in:

  config/environment.rb (session key/secret)
  config/initializers/security.rb
  config/initializers/site_keys.rb

Be sure to configure these to your liking. It is especially important to add unique site keys
for the encryption of user passwords. This can be done automatically with:

  rake auth:gen:site_key

=== SETUP
 
After migrating the database, run:

  rake setup

The setup program will create a root user and an initial admin user.  The root user is a kind of 
back door; while you never log in as root, the root user will have access to every password on the
system.

The setup task will write the root user's private key to a file called "root_key.rsa" in the app's
top-level folder. YOU MUST REMOVE THIS FILE AND STORE IT IN A SAFE PLACE.  Should you ever be
locked out of the system, the root key will allow you to decrypt any password in the database.

Start a web server, and log in as the admin user.  You can now add users and passwords.  Users can
be made into admins, which basically gives them free reign (not recommended); non-admin users can also be given
read or write access to any password group.

Note: Since private keys are encrypted using user passwords, it's important to choose
good passwords. By default, the app requires passwords of at least eight characters, with
at least one of these being an upper-case letter, and at least two non-word/number characters.

=== DOCUMENTATIOIN

This app is fairly well-documented. To view the RDoc, run

  rake doc:app

and check the doc folder.

=== LOGGING

mortimer logs all security exceptions to the main log file.

  more production.log | grep 'Security' 

== SECURITY PRECAUTIONS

1. In a production situation, this app must be run over SSL.

2. mortimer probably shouldn't be exposed to the Internet.  We use it on an internal network only.

3. We're comfortable storing sessions in a cookie, though more paranoid options are available. 

== DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS:

Note that this is an initial release. Expect regular improvements.

We certainly welcome any improvements to mortimer, particularly security patches.

== TESTS

mortimer features a fairly comprehensive test suite using Shoulda. To run the tests:

  rake test
